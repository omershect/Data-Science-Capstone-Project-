* This project is about understanding and building a predictive text model
* The goal is to use Text Data set from Blogs, News and Twitter and create an NLP Model
* The outcome is to get a sentence or a string and predict the next word
* The Last step is to build a data Product using Shiny APP that will illustrate the Prediction

## The Algorithm 

* The Algorithm used is Stupid Backoff
* All data is used (except from Twitter data - 85%)
* Data cleaning actions were done (e.g. Remove symbols, Numbers, Punctuations) 
* 1:5 sets of Ngrams were created 
* Data was trimmed based on frequency to save memory space 
* The following R packages were used: quanteda, data.table, qdap
* Stupid Backoff briefly explained below :

* Type a sentence in the slide bar (at the left)
* Push the Predict button
* The next word will be shown in the blue Window 
* 4 Lower Priority options are displayed in the green window
